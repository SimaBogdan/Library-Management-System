# Library-Managment-System

To run the application the repository needs to be copied locally. 

I used PostgreSQL for the Data Persistence so pgAdmin 4 with the content from the appsettings.json will be needed for testing.

After this from where the repository is copied to type in the terminal: cd LibraryManagementSystem

And then: dotnet run

Swagger is set up for testing (localhost:5106/swagger)

For the New Functionality I added a genre filter similar to the Search Functionality.
